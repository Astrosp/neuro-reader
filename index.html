        The other theory, quantum physics, had a more difficult birth. It was
a collaborative effort involving dozens of physicists working over the
course of nearly thirty years. Einstein was among them, but he was not
their leader; the closest thing this disorganized and unruly band of
revolutionaries had was Niels Bohr, the great Danish physicist. Bohr’s
Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen was the mecca of
quantum physics in its infancy, with nearly every big name in the field
for fifty years studying there at one point or another. The physicists
who worked there made profound discoveries across nearly every field
of science: they developed the first genuine theory of quantum physics,
found the underlying logic of the periodic table of the elements, and
used the power of radioactivity to reveal the basic workings of living
cells. And it was Bohr, along with a group of his most talented students
and colleagues—Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Max Born, Pascual
Jordan, and others—who developed and championed the “Copenhagen
interpretation,” which rapidly became the standard interpretation of the
mathematics of quantum physics.
