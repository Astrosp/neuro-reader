# 🧠 Neuro Reader

**A fixed-pivot speed-reading web app**

Neuro Reader is a browser-based speed reader designed around how human vision actually works.

Instead of forcing your eyes to jump across lines of text, Neuro Reader keeps your gaze fixed on a single optical pivot while each word moves so its most information-dense letter passes through that point. This dramatically reduces eye movement, fatigue, and cognitive overhead — allowing you to read faster while retaining comprehension.

#### Fixed Optical Pivot  
A stable vertical guide shows where your eyes should stay. Each word is aligned so its pivot letter lands on that exact point.

#### Dynamic Word Alignment  
Words slide and scale so even long ones never force your eyes to move.

#### Punctuation-Aware Timing  
Commas, periods, and sentence endings automatically adjust pacing for natural rhythm.

#### Keyboard Control  
Press **Space** to Play / Pause.

#### Play / Pause / Stop Controls  
Pause resumes from the same word. Stop resets and unlocks the text.

#### Pivot Guide Toggle  
Turn the red guide line on or off once your eye is trained.

### 🧠 How It Works

Human vision has a tiny high-resolution center (the fovea) and a blurry periphery.  
Traditional reading forces the eyes to jump constantly, which limits speed and increases fatigue.

Neuro Reader uses a fixed visual anchor.  
Your eyes stay still while words move beneath them, using a pivot letter that carries most of the recognition information.

This turns reading from a motor task (eye movement) into a perception task (pattern recognition), which the brain can perform much faster.
